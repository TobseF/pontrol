### Story
In the future, cyber war will be fought by hackers. You
are responsible to keep the network clean and defend wrong
data packages or viruses. Allow the yellow packages to pass the
line and block the others with your cyber weapons.

### Controls
Left mouse: Hack a network node and place a *Block*. Click to change its
color. Select two **Line** nodes to connect them.
Right mouse: Change the hacked node type.

**Block**: Block an incoming package with the same color  
**Transform**: Changes the color of an incoming package.  
**Line**: Used to build connections which transfer packages between
two data lines. First build **Line**-1 and **Line**-2 and select them,
to build a connection.
